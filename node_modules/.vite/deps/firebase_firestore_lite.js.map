Such a class could,\n * for example, have properties with complex, nested data types, properties used\n * for memoization, properties of types not supported by Firestore (such as\n * `symbol` and `bigint`), and helper functions that perform compound\n * operations. Such classes are not suitable and/or possible to store into a\n * Firestore database. Instead, instances of such classes need to be converted\n * to \"plain old JavaScript objects\" (POJOs) with exclusively primitive\n * properties, potentially nested inside other POJOs or arrays of POJOs. In this\n * context, this type is referred to as the \"DbModel\" and would be an object\n * suitable for persisting into Firestore. For convenience, applications can\n * implement `FirestoreDataConverter` and register the converter with Firestore\n * objects, such as `DocumentReference` or `Query`, to automatically convert\n * `AppModel` to `DbModel` when storing into Firestore, and convert `DbModel`\n * to `AppModel` when retrieving from Firestore.\n *\n * @example\n *\n * Simple Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * const numberConverter = {\n *     toFirestore(value: WithFieldValue<number>) {\n *         return { value };\n *     },\n *     fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot, options: SnapshotOptions) {\n *         return snapshot.data(options).value as number;\n *     }\n * };\n *\n * async function simpleDemo(db: Firestore): Promise<void> {\n *     const documentRef = doc(db, 'values/value123').withConverter(numberConverter);\n *\n *     // converters are used with `setDoc`, `addDoc`, and `getDoc`\n *     await setDoc(documentRef, 42);\n *     const snapshot1 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot1.data(), 42);\n *\n *     // converters are not used when writing data with `updateDoc`\n *     await updateDoc(documentRef, { value: 999 });\n *     const snapshot2 = await getDoc(documentRef);\n *     assertEqual(snapshot2.data(), 999);\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * Advanced Example\n *\n * ```typescript\n * // The Post class is a model that is used by our application.\n * // This class may have properties and methods that are specific\n * // to our application execution, which do not need to be persisted\n * // to Firestore.\n * class Post {\n *     constructor(\n *         readonly title: string,\n *         readonly author: string,\n *         readonly lastUpdatedMillis: number\n *     ) {}\n *     toString(): string {\n *         return `${this.title} by ${this.author}`;\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * // The PostDbModel represents how we want our posts to be stored\n * // in Firestore. This DbModel has different properties (`ttl`,\n * // `aut`, and `lut`) from the Post class we use in our application.\n * interface PostDbModel {\n *     ttl: string;\n *     aut: { firstName: string; lastName: string };\n *     lut: Timestamp;\n * }\n *\n * // The `PostConverter` implements `FirestoreDataConverter` and specifies\n * // how the Firestore SDK can convert `Post` objects to `PostDbModel`\n * // objects and vice versa.\n * class PostConverter implements FirestoreDataConverter<Post, PostDbModel> {\n *     toFirestore(post: WithFieldValue<Post>): WithFieldValue<PostDbModel> {\n *         return {\n *             ttl: post.title,\n *             aut: this._autFromAuthor(post.author),\n *             lut: this._lutFromLastUpdatedMillis(post.lastUpdatedMillis)\n *         };\n *     }\n *\n *     fromFirestore(snapshot: QueryDocumentSnapshot, options: SnapshotOptions): Post {\n *         const data = snapshot.data(options) as PostDbModel;\n *         const author = `${data.aut.firstName} ${data.aut.lastName}`;\n *         return new Post(data.ttl, author, data.lut.toMillis());\n *     }\n *\n *     _autFromAuthor(\n *         author: string | FieldValue\n *     ): { firstName: string; lastName: string } | FieldValue {\n *         if (typeof author !== 'string') {\n *             // `author` is a FieldValue, so just return it.\n *             return author;\n *         }\n *         const [firstName, lastName] = author.split(' ');\n *         return {firstName, lastName};\n *     }\n *\n *     _lutFromLastUpdatedMillis(\n *         lastUpdatedMillis: number | FieldValue\n *     ): Timestamp | FieldValue {\n *         if (typeof lastUpdatedMillis !== 'number') {\n *             // `lastUpdatedMillis` must be a FieldValue, so just return it.\n *             return lastUpdatedMillis;\n *         }\n *         return Timestamp.fromMillis(lastUpdatedMillis);\n *     }\n * }\n *\n * async function advancedDemo(db: Firestore): Promise<void> {\n *     // Create a `DocumentReference` with a `FirestoreDataConverter`.\n *     const documentRef = doc(db, 'posts/post123').withConverter(new PostConverter());\n *\n *     // The `data` argument specified to `setDoc()` is type checked by the\n *     // TypeScript compiler to be compatible with `Post`.
